ðŸ”¸ Skills used : 
- STRING FUNCTIONS (CONCAT, SPLIT, REPLACE, TRIM, UPPER)
- DATE/TIME FUNCTIONS (TIMESTAMP, DATETIME, EXTRACT, TRUNC, PARSE, FORMAT) 



ðŸ“„ STRING FUNCTIONS Practice 

SELECT
  CONCAT ("Hi", "Hello", "!") AS result_1
==> Hi Hello !

SELECT 
  SPLIT ("A, B, C, D",", ") AS result_2
==> "A", "B", "C", "D"

SELECT
  REPLACE ("Hi Hello", "Hi", "Good morning") AS result_3
==> Good morning Hello 

SELECT
  TRIM ("Hi Hello", "Hello") AS result_4
==> Hi 

SELECT
  UPPER ("abc") AS result_5
==> ABC
